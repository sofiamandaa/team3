        <h2>Dining007 </h2>
        <p>
            Our restaurant is about excellent food and tasteful wines and drinks. We wanted to make our restaurant a place where you can relax and have a good time with your friends and family. We wanted to pursue a Mid-European style so that the vibe is fresh and goes along with our menu. 
        We believe that you canâ€™t go wrong with good food and great company.
        </p>

        <h2>Premises</h2>
        <p>The restaurant is a total of 150m<sup>2</sup> and it has two different sides: bar/lounge and restaurant. 
            The restaurant is a wide and cozy space, about 90m<sup>2</sup> and it is linked to the bar with a small hallway. You are able to move around with wheelchair, our restaurant has an unobstructed passage both in the bar and in the restaurant. </p>

            <h2>Parties and meetings</h2>
        <p>You can book our restaurant for an evening, a day or for a whole weekend! There have been many birthday parties; sweet sixteens and celebrations of the big 50, and also bachelor parties and even a few weddings. 
            Or if you want to gather a meeting outside the office with good food and relaxing atmosphere, you can ask for an offer for a private meeting package. Otherwise feel free to book a table from our restaurant for a nice business dinner.
